This is the official Github organization for [Trident](https://trident.bot), the leading roleplay management bot on [Discord](https://discord.com). Trident was a project started in November 2022 to redefine roleplay management, since then, we have reached over 5,000 communities on Discord - we are now the leading service in roleplay management.
